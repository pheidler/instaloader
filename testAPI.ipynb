      "This one is a sandstone. It's from the very prominent bluffs surrounding Billings, Montana. If I'm not mistaken, it was once sand and clay and soil which was later turned into a silty sandstone rock, and then eroded by the waves of an inland sea. It is now slowly decomposing back into sand and silt. I'd guess it's pretty typical of the sandstones I've tried - lots of silica and alumina. They need to be milled very finely to melt. A mix of 50% sandstone to 50% runny high flux materials make for interesting high fire glazes. Where it interacts with the soda, it fluxed nicely. \n",

Eventually I'll write a script on my blog to automatically collect these posts from Instagram and FB, pin them to a map, and put the information into a database.

I want to get this research out of our studios and onto a free and open website. I want to involve other people. I only have so much time, energy, and motivation. We can set it up to start building itself - in the meantime I'll start collecting and organizing them.
