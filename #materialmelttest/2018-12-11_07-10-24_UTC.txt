Monday means another Montana Material Melt Test! 
Here's the Chugwater formation, which is found all over the West. I found it here, exposed by this roadcut. It's a material that makes for great glazes straight out of the ground. It looks good in high fire reduction, making a tenmoku/persimmon glaze. In oxidation it's a suitable base for Oilspot glazes. The best was in a wood kiln. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ 1.Location:. NR-17 Road near Old Benbow Chromite Mine. Stillwater County, Montana 
2.Material: Red Clay and decomposed, crumbly siltstone. 
Formation/geology: Positively identified as Chugwater Formation Clay. 
3,4. Melt Test: Cone 10 Reduction = after milling and blunging it made a very nice tenmoku. In Cone 11 Oxidation it made a glossy black glaze. Additions of high iron materials made nice oilspots. Similar in some ways to Albany slip. It was a good base to mix with other found materials.
