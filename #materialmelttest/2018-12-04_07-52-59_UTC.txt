üì¶ I've got a box full of material tests I made in Montana that I never really shared. I'm gonna start posting one or two of them every monday. There's about 40 samples that I collected from all over the Beartooth Mountains. Some of them I know a lot about and some of them I don't really even know what they are. Here's an example of one that I've got a good guess, but have not positively dentified. 
I'm gonna start tagging these posts #MaterialMeltTest and start putting together a world wide database on my blog. It's a long term project I can add to gradually. I hope the format and hashtag catches on and it becomes a thing. Rocks, clays, dirt, ash, mudpuddles, or anything else gathered and melted! I'd like it to encourage collaboration between rockhounds/geologists/potters/scientists/alchemists/anyone else who is interested in this kinda thing. If you make your own glaze materials or know a potter who does you can contribute in any number of ways: Help Identify, Share, Comment, or Post. Here's a sample format: 
_____

1.Location: üìçRock Creek, Near Red Lodge, Montana 
2.Material: Unidentified River Rock ( I'm guessing a very coarse grained porphyrittic granite or rhyolite. Contains Quartz, Plagioclase Feldspar, Biotite, ...?) #whatisthisrock

3. Formation/Geology: Bearooth Mountain Range, Rock Creek River Rock 
4. Miscellaneous info: Hard, Dense Rock. Difficult to break. Suitable for further glaze development. Collected and melted by @bluepotter, 2017.

5.Melt: 
Bottom Left - 1280¬∞C (Cone 11) Oxidation. 
Bottom Right - 1260¬∞C (Reduction)
