It's still Monday in Alaska! Here's another Montana #MaterialMeltTest! 
This one is a sandstone. It's from the very prominent bluffs surrounding Billings, Montana. If I'm not mistaken, it was once sand and clay and soil which was later turned into a silty sandstone rock, and then eroded by the waves of an inland sea. It is now slowly decomposing back into sand and silt. I'd guess it's pretty typical of the sandstones I've tried - lots of silica and alumina. They need to be milled very finely to melt. A mix of 50% sandstone to 50% runny high flux materials make for interesting high fire glazes. Where it interacts with the soda, it fluxed nicely. 
If you know more about this one or any other, please comment and add to the record! Correct me or add what you know! The more the merrier ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ 1.Location:. Near Billings International Airport

2.Material: Tan grey sandstone/siltstone.

3,4. Melt Test: left Cone 10 Soda Fire = very refractory, fluxed nicely with heavy soda. Right: Cone 11 Oxidation: Mostly stayed the same. Prospected Mix 1:1:1 Sandstone: Earthenware: WoodAsh looked like a very nice cone 10 oxidation/reduction amber glaze. .
