A melt test from a new project involving the Yogo Sapphire Mine. lamprophyre, an igneous rock, is crushed in order to harvest the sapphires. I’m looking more and more at how we can work with mining companies to obtain “waste” material and apply it to glaze making. Big thanks to Don and @jeweler_jason for sharing the material! #localglaze #wildglaze #glazechemistry #yogosapphire #materialmelttest #montana #interdisciplinaryart #ilovemytestkiln
